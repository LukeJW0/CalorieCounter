# CalorieCounter
Simple Calorie Counter website I made.
The goal of the website was to create a personalized and simple way of tracking calorie and protein intake.
By entering the calories and protein of what you eat throughout the day, the website does the tracking and counting for you.

# Buttons
- Submit: Confirms and submits the entered calories and protein amounts.
- Load: Loads persistent data (previous entries) after the webpage is refreshed.
- Clear: Clears all entered data past and present.
- Export: Creates a savable text file containing the data.

# Exported file
Saves each and every entry. The top line is a list containing the amount of calories. Second line is a list containing the amount of protein. Third line is a list containing the date (Day of the month) of each entry. All ordered with each other.
